🌿 Welcome to My Jungle 🌿

Hello and welcome to my blog!
My name is Jordan, and all my life I’ve had a deep passion for plants and animals.

Some of my earliest family videos show me sitting in the grass, staring at a leaf, and saying “wow” over and over again. That sense of wonder has never left me.

🌱 How It All Started

I remember my first ever houseplant—a dumb cane (Dieffenbachia) that my late grandmother bought for me. She called it “ours.” From that moment on, it snowballed into a lifelong obsession with bringing nature indoors.

Not just plants—but any creature I could get my hands on. When I was around 10 years old, my amazing parents gifted me my first lizard: a bearded dragon I named Aragon.

Since then, I’ve cared for a wide range of life:
Tropical plants, reptiles, amphibians, fish, insects, arachnids, and crustaceans.
I’ve learned—and am still learning!—that our world is a stunning work of art. And I want to replicate that beauty indoors and share it with all of you.
